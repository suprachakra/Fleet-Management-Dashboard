## 9. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

Below are User Stories with Acceptance Criteria for some MVP features.

**F-01: Driver Roster Dashboard**

- **US-F01-01:** As a Dispatcher, I want to filter drivers by location, so that I can quickly find drivers near a specific area.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given the dashboard is open, when I select a location filter, then I see only drivers from that location in <2s.
  
- **US-F01-02:** As a Dispatcher, I want to update a driver’s status from “available” to “on break” inline, so that I can reflect changes instantly.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given a driver is “available,” when I click “on break,” then the driver’s status updates and is visible to all dispatchers immediately.

**F-03: Manual Assignment Board**

- **US-F03-01:** As a Dispatcher, I want to drag a driver onto a vehicle slot to assign them, so that I can speed up the process.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given a list of drivers and an empty vehicle slot, when I drag a driver’s icon to that slot, then the assignment saves within ≤2s and is visible to other dispatchers.
  
- **US-F03-02:** As a Dispatcher, if a driver’s license is expired, the system must block the assignment.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given a driver with an expired license, when I try to assign them, then I see a warning and the assignment does not complete.

**F-05: License & Insurance Alerts**

- **US-F05-01:** As a Compliance Officer, I want to receive alerts 7 days before a driver’s license expires, so that I can ensure renewals.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given a driver’s license is expiring in <7 days, when the dashboard loads or at the start of each day, then an alert appears in the compliance panel and an email notification is sent.

**F-07: Real-Time KPI Dashboard**

- **US-F07-01:** As an Ops Manager, I want to see the current on-time pickup rate, so that I can intervene if it drops below a set threshold.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given the dashboard is open, when it refreshes every 60s, then on-time rate data is updated and displayed in a chart format. If on-time <90%, highlight in yellow; <85%, highlight in red.

**F-09: Data Normalization**

- **US-F09-01:** As a Data Analyst, I want accurate data, so that I can trust the KPIs.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given nightly ETL runs, when discrepancies >1%, then a report is generated and sent to IT/Engineering. If <1%, no alert needed.

**F-10: API Monitoring & Alerts**

- **US-F10-01:** As IT Staff, I want to know when APIs degrade, so that I can address issues quickly.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given API latency >3s or error rate >1%, when the monitoring service detects it, then send an alert to IT Slack channel and switch to cached data if configured.

## 10. Tasks (Indicative Examples)

Tasks are execution-level items developers and teams pick up in sprints. Actual tasks may differ based on the team’s tooling (e.g., Jira):

- **For F-01 (Driver Roster Dashboard):**
  - Task 1: Implement front-end filtering logic (location, qualification)
  - Task 2: Integrate with driver API to fetch driver list
  - Task 3: Create inline edit component for driver status updates
  - Task 4: Write unit tests for filtering logic

- **For F-03 (Manual Assignment Board):**
  - Task 1: Implement drag-and-drop UI components
  - Task 2: Integrate assignment API endpoint calls
  - Task 3: Add expired license check logic before finalizing assignment
  - Task 4: Performance test to ensure <2s assignment save time

- **For F-05 (License & Insurance Alerts):**
  - Task 1: Create cron job to check upcoming expiries
  - Task 2: Implement notification module (in-dashboard + email)
  - Task 3: Write integration tests to confirm alert generation
  - Task 4: UX review to ensure alerts are prominent but not overwhelming

(Each feature would have a similar breakdown of tasks.)

---

## 11. Analytics & Continuous Improvement

- Track feature usage: How often filters are applied, how many assignments made per shift, alert acknowledgment rates.
- After MVP, review KPI improvements: If not on track (e.g., on-time pickup improved <3%), interview users for UI complexity issues or refine logic.
- Quarterly review sessions: Adjust priorities if certain features don’t move the needle on OKRs.

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                    | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                           |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| Integration failures (Legacy APIs)       | Medium      | High   | Sandbox testing, caching, retries     |
| Data inaccuracies (affect predictions)   | High        | Medium | Daily discrepancy checks, refine ETL  |
| Low user adoption                        | Medium      | High   | Prototype tests, UX improvements      |
| Regulatory changes                       | Medium      | Medium | Modular compliance logic, quick updates|
| Performance bottlenecks at peak          | Low         | High   | Load tests each PI, autoscaling        |

If triggers occur (e.g., user adoption <20%), implement immediate UI revisions or additional training.

---

## 13. QA & Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** ≥90% coverage, run on each commit.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate end-to-end data flows pre-MVP.
- **Performance Tests:** Load test under peak conditions pre-MVP.
- **Security Tests:** Quarterly penetration tests, fix critical issues ASAP.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Screen reader and keyboard-only tests pre-release.
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing):** Run pilot in one dispatch center; if ≥3 critical defects, fix before full launch.

Continuous monitoring of test results ensures maintaining quality standards.

---

## 14. UX & Design Principles

- **Brand Consistency:** Adhere to corporate branding (colors, fonts, icons).
- **Minimalism & Clarity:** Show essential KPIs first; drill-down on secondary screens.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Iterative UX Refinement:** Monthly usability tests; if >30% confusion, redesign before next release.

Use feedback loops to continuously improve UI layouts and reduce cognitive load.

---

## 15. Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

- **Pre-MVP (Months 1-4):**  
  - Internal awareness via Slack updates, early prototypes to select users.
- **MVP Launch (Month 5):**  
  - Training videos, quick-start guides distributed company-wide.
  - Webinars/Q&A sessions for dispatchers and compliance officers.
  - Intranet posts highlighting expected improvements (e.g., “20% faster assignments”).
- **Post-MVP (6+ Months):**  
  - Feedback channel open for suggestions.
  - Monthly updates showcasing improvements in metrics (on-time rates, compliance success).

**Measurement of GTM Success:**
- Track internal NPS among dispatchers and ops managers (target >4.7/5).
- Monitor training material consumption (video watch rates, webinar attendance).
- If adoption lags or confusion persists (>20% negative feedback), create tailored follow-up training or adjust the UI to reduce complexity.

**Note:**  
- “Community Engagement Tools” refers internally to the organization’s user community (dispatchers, ops managers, compliance officers, etc.). If external community involvement exists, we need to adjust accordingly.  
- The communications plan and strategy are reflected in the “Community Engagement Tools,” “Review & Feedback Points,” and references to Slack channels, newsletters, training sessions, and forums.  
- SAFe milestones are mentioned at key increments (e.g., PI Planning, MVP release at PI boundary, Inspect & Adapt sessions).
